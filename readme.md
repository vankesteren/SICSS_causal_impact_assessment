## Course objectives

How do we assess whether a school policy intervention has had the desired effect on student performance? How do we estimate the impact a natural disaster has had on the inhabitants of affected regions? How can we determine whether a change in the maximum speed on highways has lead to fewer accidents? These types of questions are at the core of many social scientific research problems. While questions with this structure are seemingly simple, their _causal effects_ are notoriously hard to estimate, because often we cannot perform a randomized controlled experiment. 

In this session, we will deal with several advanced methods for answering such questions, with a dual focus:

- What are the causal assumptions underlying these methods?
- How can we put these methods in practice?

At the end of this session, participants have a firm grasp of the basics and limits of causal impact assessment, as well as the skills to start applying these methods in their own work.

## Prerequisites

We assume the following:

- you are comfortable with estimating and interpreting regression models
- you are familiar with the `R` programming language and you have a recent version installed
- it's a bonus if you are somewhat familiar with the `tidyverse` suite of packages (`readr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot`, `tibble`)
- you have installed the following `R` packages on your computer:
  - `tidyverse`
  - `sandwich`
  - `lmtest`
  - `fpp3`
  - `tidysynth`

  You can use the following code to install these at once:
  ```r
  install.packages(c("tidyverse", "sandwich", "lmtest", "fpp3", "tidysynth"))
  ```

## Workshop schedule & materials

See the schedule below. Note that some of the practicals are interrupted by breaks or lunch. We aim to end by 15:00.

You can download the dataset we have prepared from here: [`proposition99.rds`](./data/proposition99.rds). In the first practical, you will save it in a nicely accessible place, as we will be using it in every subsequent practical.
